           <h2>Hobbies</h2>
           <p>A healthy mind is an active mind, and to this end, Sean has several hobbies to keep his mind in motion.</p>
            <h3>Recycled Computation</h3>
            <p>More a hobby of circumstance, Sean enjoys salvaging computers that have been left out on garbage day, and building computers from his growing stockpile of functional components. He's particularly fond of hardware from the late 90's and early 2000's.</p>
            <h3>Moeagare, Gandamu!</h3>
            <p>In his free time, Sean assembles model Gundams, known as Gunpla. His current project is a Master Grade RX-93 Î½ Gundam. Previously completed projects include a High Grade RX-78-2 Gundam, a High Grade GF13-017NJ Shining Gundam, a High Grade MBF-P02 Gundam Astray Red Frame, and a Gundam: The Origin variant High Grade MS-06S Zaku-II.</p>
            <h3>Natural 20!</h3>
            <p>Sean regularly participates in tabletop RPG sessions with his regular group. They're fond of strong narrative thrills, character development, collaborative storytelling, and above all else, tales of death-defying high adventure! Together, they have played Fantasy Craft, Pathfinder, GURPS, FATE, both Old and New World of Darkness, Delta Green, Shadowrun 4th Edition, Cyberpunk 2020 2nd Edition, every edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons</p>
